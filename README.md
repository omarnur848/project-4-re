Combined three csv files DOGE, ETH, and Bitcoin into one combine_df using spark.sql in the combine_df.ipynb. Cleaned the combine_df of any errors and added prediction rows using a Linear Regression model with hvplots in CleaningDataLinRegModel.ipynb. Additionally, created a reinforced model in project-4.ipynb. Kim.ipynb workbook uses a randomforest model to show a more robust perdictive model using the findings in the other workbooks.
